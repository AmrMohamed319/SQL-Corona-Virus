# Corona Virus Dataset SQL Project
This SQL project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive dataset related to the Corona Virus pandemic. The dataset includes critical information such as confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries across various regions and dates. Through a series of SQL queries, the project aims to uncover significant insights and trends in the spread and impact of the virus.

1) Province
2) Country/Region
3) Latitude
4) Longitude
5) Date
6) Confirmed
7) Deaths
8) Recovered

## Project details
The analysis addresses a variety of questions, from basic data validation to advanced statistical analysis, including:

* Checking for and handling NULL values.
* Calculating the total number of rows and the range of dates in the dataset.
* Determining monthly averages and the most frequent values for key metrics.
* Identifying minimum and maximum values for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries per year.
* Analyzing the spread of the virus concerning confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, including measures of central tendency and variability.
* Identifying countries with the highest and lowest numbers of cases, as well as the top 5 countries with the highest recovery rates.
